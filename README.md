## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I improved on my knowledge on using Flexbox, I can confidently solve more complex layout issues using flex box now, all i have to do is to scale up the experience that I gained here and the previously stacked ones.

### Continued development

I want to get a hang of controlling the cursor in terms of responsiveness and being able to control its color too amongst other things
